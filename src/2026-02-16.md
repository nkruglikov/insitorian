Elections were first introduced in December 2019 with the
Expanse update. In June 2024, the Realpolitik update revamped
the system, replacing solo governors with parliaments.

Elections are usually quite boring in Prosperous Universe.
Being in the government is considered a thankless task, so the
old governor and their parliament usually get reelected without
issues. However, upcoming elections on Promitor, the most
populous planet in the universe, and also some neighbouring
planets, are unusually heated. The incumbent government of
{% player "Schaitr" %}, who has 3.5 years of playtime
experience, is challenged by the newcomer
{% player "Euu" %}, who has 4 months of experience.
