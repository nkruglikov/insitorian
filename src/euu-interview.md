## Background

**First, I'd like to talk a bit about your background so that
voters who are not fully familiar with you can get to know you
better. How did you learn about PrUn? What attracted you, and
what made you stay there?**

A friend introduced me to this game. I found the gameplay
interesting, and playing it with friends has been very enjoyable.

**What are your current long-term goals in-game?**

My current long-term goal is to grow and expand the Chinese
community and to transform the organization I lead into a large
economic entity.

**Can you share anything about your real-life background or
profession, and how it relates to PrUn?**

I own multiple businesses in various countries, including the
UK, the USA, Hong Kong, and mainland China. My businesses
involve artificial intelligence, the food and beverage industry,
and agricultural production.

## Elections

**Why did you decide to run?**

I was dissatisfied with the fact that government funds were
sitting idle. In Chinese culture, the government should be
responsible for construction and development; allowing funds to
remain idle is considered irresponsible. At the time I announced
my candidacy, both Schaitr and COSM strongly opposed using
government funds for any cause. After my announcement, Schaitr
changed his mind and now also supports spending government
funds. COSM then fell in line with him.

**Do you have a particular attachment to the Insitor region or
are you more interested in the galaxy as a whole?**

Previously, I favored Insitor, since it is the region I started
in, and promoted it in my tutorials. However, after the events
surrounding the elections, I am dissatisfied with COSM, which is
the dominant force in the Insitor region. So I don't confine
myself to Insitor anymore.

**Why are you interested in a position of power or
responsibility? Do you usually take such positions in other
games or in real life?**

I'm generally not interested in positions of power, but I will
strongly advocate against something I believe is unreasonable,
and this applies to me in real life as well.

## Policy

**In your latest proposal published on the Promitor chat, you
pledge to spend 40% of funds to purchase gate construction
materials, 20% to develop new planets and 17% to directly fund
bases for gateway materials production. Is this a correct
description? What will happen with the remaining 23% of the
funds?**

The remaining 23% will be used to maintain the existing
infrastructure on the planets.

**Who would you purchase the gate construction materials from?**

I will purchase the materials from large corporations: COSM, GTU
(Schaitr) and others, even from OOG. Gateways are a large and
long-term undertaking and government funds are insufficient for
this project. Because of this, it's necessary to develop more
planets specializing in metallurgy, manufacturing, and
construction. This will promote overall development. The current
situation is a mess.

**Schaitr proposes another way to finance gateway construction:
base leases. Why do you think your way is better?**

I think both ways are fine. We just have different preferences.
Schaitr runs a lot of base leasing programs, so he prefers
leases. I do a lot of lending, so I prefer lending.

We don't have any conflict with Schaitr. It is miscommunication
with COSM that was the problem. To be clear, I am not part of
COSM anymore, I represent my own policy in this election.

**Currently, it's impossible to explore your bank website
without registering. Some might think that this is not very
transparent. What do you think about this? Would you allow
browsing the website without registration in future?**

You don't need to provide any personal information to register
on the bank website. You only need to enter your in-game
nickname so that I can contact you. If someone can't even manage
to sign up, I don't think the issue is my lack of transparency
but rather their bias.

## Politics

**You seem to be running alone. Are you planning to introduce
allies who would run in the elections alongside you? If yes, who
would they be?**

I have my allies running alongside me: heiheihahei and Tnn. We
played together from the start. We might be less famous than
veteran players, but we have more energy, and we have better
ideas. I think that playing together is part of the fun in the
game.

I've already announced my allies publicly but the information
might have been lost due to the volume of messages.

**One notable aspect of this election is that the group who
support you seems to be exclusively Chinese-speaking. Is this
election a power struggle between Chinese- and English-speaking
factions?**

Currently, most of my supporters are from the Chinese community.
There are also some English-speaking players who support me, but
not many. That's okay. My plan would benefit everyone. Unlike
COSM, which changed its stance just before the election, I will
fulfill my obligations to my supporters and won't back down from
my platform.
