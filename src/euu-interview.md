## Background

**How did you learn about PrUn? What attracted you and what
made you stay?**

A friend introduced me to this game. I found the gameplay
interesting, and playing it with friends has been very enjoyable.

{% zh %}
朋友介绍了解到这个游戏的。经济玩法让我感觉很有趣，和朋友一起玩有很多趣事。
{% endzh %}

**What are your current long-term goals in-game?**

My current long-term goal is to grow and expand the Chinese
community and to transform the organization I lead into a large
economic entity.

{% zh %}
现在的长期目标就是发展壮大中文社区，将我所领导的组织打造成一个大型经济体。
{% endzh %}

**Can you share anything about your real-life background or
profession and how it relates to PrUn?**

I own multiple businesses in various countries, including the
UK, the USA, Hong Kong, and mainland China. My businesses
involve artificial intelligence, the food and beverage industry,
and agricultural production.

{% zh %}
我在现实生活中拥有多家企业，设立在多国。英国，美国，香港，中国内地。从事人工智能以及餐饮行业，以及农业生产。
{% endzh %}

## Elections

**Why did you decide to run?**

I was dissatisfied with the fact that government funds were
sitting idle. In Chinese culture, the government should be
responsible for construction and development; allowing funds to
remain idle is considered irresponsible. At the time I announced
my candidacy, both {% player "Schaitr" %} and COSM strongly
opposed using government funds for any cause. After my
announcement, {% player "Schaitr" %} changed his mind and now
also supports spending government
funds. COSM then fell in line with him.

{% zh %}
关于选举，我们最终注意到政府的资金在沉睡，
这让我们感到不满。在中国的文化中政府应该承担
建设以及开发的责任，让资金进入闲置是一种
不负责任的表现。在当时{% player "Schaitr" %}以及COSM都极力
反对动用政府资金进行任何改变。目前的争议已经
被消除，{% player "Schaitr" %}已经改变了初衷，动用政府资金
已经被允许，COSM则是没有主见仅仅作为支持
{% player "Schaitr" %}的一方，无论政策是什么。
{% endzh %}

**Do you have a particular attachment to the Insitor region or
are you more interested in the galaxy as a whole?**

Previously, I favored Insitor, since it is the region I started
in, and promoted it in my tutorials. However, after the events
surrounding the elections, I am dissatisfied with COSM, which is
the dominant force in the Insitor region. So I don't confine
myself to Insitor anymore.

{% zh %}
目前我已经不再限于INS地区，之前我在推广中
会更倾向于INS地区，因为游戏之中有派系区分。
由于最近一系列的事情发生，我对于INS地区的
主导者COSM感到不满，我不会再被限制于INS地区，
我会更倾向于宇宙的发展。
{% endzh %}

**Why are you interested in a position of power or
responsibility? Do you usually take such positions in other
games or in real life?**

I'm generally not interested in positions of power, but I will
strongly advocate against something I believe is unreasonable,
and this applies to me in real life as well.

{% zh %}
对于权力职位我通常不感兴趣，当我认为这项事情
不合理时我会极力促成，即在现实生活我也是如此。
{% endzh %}

## Policy

**In your latest proposal published on the Promitor chat, you
pledged to spend 40% of funds to purchase gate construction
materials, 20% to develop new planets and 17% to directly fund
bases for gateway materials production. Is this a correct
description? What will happen with the remaining 23% of the
funds?**

The remaining 23% will be used to maintain the existing
infrastructure on the planets.

{% zh %}
剩下的23%用于星球自身的维护。
{% endzh %}

**Who would you purchase the gate construction materials from?**

I will purchase the materials from large corporations: COSM, GTU
({% player "Schaitr" %}) and others, even from OOG. Gateways
are a large and
long-term undertaking and government funds are insufficient for
this project. Because of this, it's necessary to develop more
planets specializing in metallurgy, manufacturing, and
construction. This will promote overall development. The current
situation is a mess.

{% zh %}
我会继续向COSM以及GTU还有其他地区的集团
进行购买，甚至是火星的OOG。这并不能作为一个
短期计划来看，更像是一个长期项目。可见政府
资金完全不足以支付一个完整的星门，所以开发
配套的冶金星球和制造星球、土木星球是必要的。
这将促进整体的进步而不是像现在一样乱成一锅粥。
{% endzh %}

**{% player "Schaitr" %} proposes another way to finance gateway construction:
base leases. Why do you think your way is better?**

I think both ways are fine. We just have different preferences.
{% player "Schaitr" %} runs a lot of base leasing programs, so
he prefers leases. I do a lot of lending, so I prefer lending.

I don't have any conflict with {% player "Schaitr" %}. It's
miscommunication with COSM that was the problem. To be clear,
I am not part of COSM anymore; I represent my own policy in
this election.

{% zh %}
我个人认为这是习惯的问题，他喜欢租赁而我喜欢
通过贷款间接扶持，其实区别不大。我们都没有
因为没有当总督而停止我们的计划，他依然在进行
租赁，我依然在放贷。

我和{% player "Schaitr" %}没有任何矛盾，仅仅是因为在COSM的
沟通中出现了问题导致了这一系列问题。目前我
已经脱离了COSM，仅代表我的执政理念进行选举。
{% endzh %}

**Currently, it's impossible to explore your bank website
without registering. Some might think that this is not very
transparent. What do you think about this? Would you allow
browsing the website without registration in future?**

You don't need to provide any personal information to register
on the bank website. You only need to enter your in-game
nickname so that I can contact you. If someone can't even manage
to sign up, I don't think the issue is my lack of transparency
but rather their bias.

{% zh %}
银行网站的注册不需要你的任何信息，仅需要你
使用你的董事名称作为账户让我可以找到你。
如果连注册都做不到，我想并不是因为我不进行
公开，而是这部分人拥有偏见。
{% endzh %}

## Politics

**You seem to be running alone. Are you planning to introduce
allies who would run in the elections alongside you? If yes, who
would they be?**

I have my allies running alongside me:
{% player "heiheihahei" %} and {% player "Tnn" %}. We
played together from the start. We might be less famous than
veteran players, but we have more energy, and we have better
ideas. I think that playing together is part of the fun in the
game.

I've already announced my allies publicly but the information
might have been lost due to the volume of messages.

{% zh %}
是的我之前公开过一次，但是信息太多可能已经
消失了。我们的人员包括{% player "heiheihahei" %}和{% player "Tnn" %}。

我们来自同一个团队，我们的经验都是相同的。
我们可能没有老玩家那样沉稳，但是我们有更好的
想法以及更好的活力。我相信这也是游戏的一些
趣味。
{% endzh %}

**One notable aspect of this election is that the group who
support you seems to be exclusively Chinese-speaking. Is this
election a power struggle between Chinese- and English-speaking
factions?**

Currently, most of my supporters are from the Chinese community.
There are also some English-speaking players who support me, but
not many. That's okay. My plan would benefit everyone. Unlike
COSM, which changed its stance just before the election, I will
fulfill my obligations to my supporters and won't back down from
my platform.

{% zh %}
我的计划并不局限于哪个团体，目前大多数支持者
来自中文社区，也有讲英语的玩家支持我但是不多，
这没什么问题。{% player "Schaitr" %}和COSM的政策是在选举
开始的时候临时做出了改变，而最先提出这个观点
的人是我，但是COSM毫不犹豫的抛弃了我。
那么现在选举进行中，我不会放弃，
我会对支持我的人负责到底。
{% endzh %}
