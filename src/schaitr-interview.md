## Background

**How did you learn about PrUn? What attracted you and what
made you stay?**

I believe I saw a Youtube advert on Spacedock or Eckhart, and
I gave it a try because it sounded interesting. I have this
thing for making plans so things run smoothly (e.g. management
games), so this scratched that itch somewhat.

**What are your current long-term goals in-game?**

My in-game goals have been consistently making sure new players
feel welcome, and providing support for them where I can. The
more new players stay around, the larger the community and the
richer the markets will become. We've all been there before,
when you have to decide which consumable or material to
sacrifice because you won't have enough money to keep
production running. If I can provide some support and prevent
new players from simply giving up because they've hit a brick
wall, I'd do it since I am in a position to do so.

Just some statistics to back up what I said. I've sold 430 ship
upgrade kits so far, and I bear the losses from subsidising
these kits. I've also issued 113 base lease deals, of which the
majority result in 10k/day losses, and the rest make me 1k/day.
If I wanted to, the money could have been deployed on more
profitable endeavors, but that doesn't appeal to me compared to
helping new players.

**Can you share anything about your real-life background or
profession and how it relates to PrUn?**

Nope, not going to share anything, except that Mandarin is my
second language, and this has been really helpful these past few
weeks.

## Elections

**Why did you decide to run?**

I believe that public funds (even in-game currency which have
no real world applications) should be used in a transparent and
accountable manner, and I am very concerned that it won't be. I
don't believe that loans are the best way forward with public
funds because only a few people will benefit from what everyone
has collectively paid for through taxes. I have nothing against
loans — privately funded loans are a real help for new
players — but I'm against using public funds for loans.

**What planets are contested currently?**

Promitor and Avalon, and I believe the opposition also wants to
contest Boucher and Helion Prime.

**Do you have a particular attachment to the Insitor region or
are you more interested in the galaxy as a whole?**

Of course [I am attached to Insitor], and Promitor holds a
special place. This is also why the base lease deals were only
open to Promitor folks for the longest of time. However, I
still offer the subsidised newbie ship upgrade packs to anyone,
not just people from Insitor.

**Why are you interested in a position of power or
responsibility? Do you usually take such positions in other
games or in real life?**

Nope. Being able to make things run smoothly gives me joy, and
being a governor lets me help manage the planet's population
and the inputs required for infrastructure and CoGC. Added
bonus when I manage to pare down the unemployed populations to
just what's needed, so that no infrastructure inputs need to be
wasted.

## Policy

**Your main proposal is to use government funds to finance
"base leases" for producing gateway materials. You've run many
such programs in the past. Can you explain to an unfamiliar
reader how these deals work in general?**

This is basically leasing your permit to build a base, with you
repaying by sending me the products for a set period of time.
You will need to have a PRO license, and an available permit.
Base building materials and consumables will be provided
on-site, and the products will be sent back to me on-site, so
no shipping is required from you at all. This is done quite
regularly by older players because HQ permits get really
expensive later on. For me though, I'm not in it to expand my
own production or profits, but to stimulate economic activity in
the Insitor region. As stated earlier, I either make a
substantial loss, or at most very little profit from such lease
deals.

**Can you describe a concrete example of a potential base lease
deal for gateway construction, with numbers and other
details?**

This depends on the complexity that participants are confident
in dealing with. If you prefer a simpler base, we could set you
up with a "feeder base" that provides materials for the
intermediate or final gateway products, e.g. a 24-POL PG
production base. If you're fine with a more complex setup, we
could set you up with an Afab production base instead, which
would include integrated Rfab production onsite (5 PP3 and 5
PP4).

**What are the alternative ways to finance gateway
construction and why do you think base leases are the best
option?**

Base leases are not meant to finance gateway construction —
they contribute directly to making the gateway parts. We could
just buy the available parts off CX, of course, but that would
leave us at the mercy of market prices (which are horrendous).
Other regions have depended on donations from established
players, and massive investment of time to plan the different
bases. COSM is doing the same for the Insitor region, but have
been depending on their own more established members to produce
the parts. Base leases allow anyone to participate and
contribute to the gateway construction project.

**You say that you oppose loans because they only benefit some
players. How is that different from base leases? And by the
way, how would the players receiving the deals be chosen?**

Loans may not directly contribute to the gateway project,
depending on whether they are limited to gateway-related bases.
As far as I know, the opposition group wants to use gov funds
to develop their own planets, rather than to contribute to
something which will benefit all taxpayers. Base leases that
are geared towards gateways will speed up gateway construction,
which will benefit Promitor residents.

Besides the usual PRO, and having some time in the game as a
proxy to show your commitment to the game to reduce the chances
of ghosting, there are no restrictions on who gets chosen.

**Before the challenge from {% player "Euu" %} came, the
government funds were stagnant for a very long time. Why?**

This is partly my fault. As I've stated multiple times,
privately and publicly, the surplus will be channelled towards
gateways. What I didn't do was to check in with COSM whether
they could deploy the funds when they started their gateway
project.

## Politics

**Who are your running mates on each of the contested planets?
Can you introduce them? How did you pick them?**

On Promitor, my running mates are {% player "Filefolders" %}
and {% player "PurpleOrange" %}. They are senior officers of
COSM. I believe File doesn't need to be introduced since he has
been very active helping answer questions on Prom chat.
{% player "PurpleOrange" %} works quietly in the background but
is the main man behind the whole gateway project for Insitor.

On Avalon, my running mates are {% player "Filefolders" %} and
{% player "Tegridy" %}. {% player "Tegridy" %} is a senior
representative of
the CN community.

All of us are aligned in the vision of how we want Insitor
region to be, and how public funds should be used to fund
public projects that benefit all, instead of a few.

**These elections are parliamentary. So the important question
is not who collects the most votes individually but whose group
will gain the most seats. But what would happen if one side
gained the most seats, but the other one gained the most votes
for an individual?**

As you said, it's a parliamentary election, so it's a team
effort.

**One notable aspect of this election is that the group who
oppose you seems to be exclusively Chinese-speaking. Is this
election a power struggle between Chinese- and English-speaking
factions? Is the divide caused mostly by language and
technology barriers, or are there cultural differences as
well?**

I don't find it constructive to see it as Mandarin-speakers vs
English-speakers. This assumes that both groups are monolithic,
which they are not. I speak both Mandarin and English. Where
does that put me then? What came out to me from the saga in
Prom chat was that there are real language barriers, and we do
not have many who can understand both sides. Translation
softwares do not capture cultural nuances and may feed
misunderstandings. I have been reaching out to the
Mandarin-speaking community to try to reduce such
misunderstandings, even down to asking them to type in Mandarin
instead of using translation softwares.

**Speaking of which, are you planning to represent both
language factions, or are you catering more to one of the
groups?**

I cater to anyone in the Insitor region. As stated earlier, I
find it very unconstructive and divisive to group people into
the language they speak.
